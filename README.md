# Unity Kids' Bedroom – C# Fundamentals Demo

Welcome to the **Unity Kids' Bedroom Project**! 🎮
This project is a playful and interactive Unity scene designed to demonstrate **C# programming fundamentals** in a fun environment — a cozy kids’ bedroom.

The application introduces key coding concepts (variables, conditionals, loops, functions, events, and object-oriented principles) through interactive objects in the scene.

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Objects** – Click and interact with toys, furniture, and lights.
* **C# Fundamentals Demonstrated:**

  * Variables (e.g., toy counts, scores).
  * Conditionals (turn lights on/off depending on state).
  * Loops (animate toy movement).
  * Functions (methods triggered on interactions).
  * Events & Delegates (doorbell rings → toys react).
  * Classes & Objects (each bedroom item has its own script).
* **Kid-Friendly Visuals** – Bright colors, cozy design, and playful vibe.
