Here’s a polished **GitHub README.md** you can use for your Unity application that demonstrates C# fundamentals inside a kids’ bedroom scene:

# Unity Kids' Bedroom – C# Fundamentals Demo

Welcome to the **Unity Kids' Bedroom Project**! 🎮
This project is a playful and interactive Unity scene designed to demonstrate **C# programming fundamentals** in a fun environment — a cozy kids’ bedroom.

The application introduces key coding concepts (variables, conditionals, loops, functions, events, and object-oriented principles) through interactive objects in the scene.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Objects** – Click and interact with toys, furniture, and lights.
* **C# Fundamentals Demonstrated:**

  * Variables (e.g., toy counts, scores).
  * Conditionals (turn lights on/off depending on state).
  * Loops (animate toy movement).
  * Functions (methods triggered on interactions).
  * Events & Delegates (doorbell rings → toys react).
  * Classes & Objects (each bedroom item has its own script).
* **Kid-Friendly Visuals** – Bright colors, cozy design, and playful vibe.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) (Unity 2021.3 LTS or later recommended)
* Basic knowledge of C# and Unity

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-kids-bedroom.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity Hub.
3. Load the **KidsBedroom.unity** scene.
4. Press ▶️ *Play* to explore and interact.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

This project is perfect for **beginners** learning Unity + C#. By the end, you will:

* Understand how Unity uses C# scripts to drive behavior.
* See how OOP concepts apply to game objects.
* Learn how events and delegates decouple code.
* Gain confidence writing simple but structured scripts.

Would you like me to also create a **diagram-style graphic** (e.g., bedroom layout mockup with labels for where C# concepts are demonstrated) for your README? That could make it more engaging visually.
